## About
Gardening Days rewards contributors for building the Spinnaker ecosystem. All contributions attendees make in the week add up to points. This includes project and plugin code, documentation, content, videos, issues [and more](https://spinnaker.io/community/gardening/what-to-hack/). All registered contributors will receive [prizes](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/blob/master/prizes.md) based on point totals, so contribute when you can. After you [sign up](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/register/), you'll be matched with a team. Teams can choose a project to compete in [a challenge category](https://github.com/spinnaker-hackathon/gardening/blob/master/challenges.md) for a team prize package. Challenges include software delivery solutions and content focused on Spinnaker, GitHub Action, Sumo Logic, AWS, New Relic, and more.

Elevate your impact with free compute from AWS, a global-friendly schedule, and [Spinnaker Summit programming](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/program/schedule/) all month long!

## Guidelines
1. No racist or other hate speech, put-downs, or sexual content allowed in hackathon meetings or channels. Keep it classy and remember that all participants have the same intrinsic value.
2. Don't be afraid to share your thoughts and ask for help in the [#gardening-general](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CV4A90DPF) and [#gardening-ineedhelp](https://spinnakerteam.slack.com/archives/CURFZGL2E) channels, or to try something new. This is a safe space!
3. Use the points system to get rewarded for valuable (if small) contributions. Abuses haven't been a problem in past Gardening Days; if they do arise, abusers will be disqualified from individual prize eligibility.
